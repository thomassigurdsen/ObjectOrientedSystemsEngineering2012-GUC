In this first portfolio we will pick 3 - 4 open-source projects. We are going to analyze each of them from a software engineering point of view. Delve into the differences of infrastructure, communication, openness, financial and social aspects of the open-source development model for these projects.

The projects we have initially chosen are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Media player classic
\item Ez publish
\item Open-dungeons
\end{itemize}
